#+title: Let's Code

*Let's Code* is a working React Router application we can hack on for fun.

* Getting started
One can lean on either =devenv= or =docker compose= to simplify setting up a
local development environment.

Regardless of how you choose to run the system, the development service will
listen on port 3000 and Storybook will listen on port 6006.

- *Application:* http://localhost:3000/
- *Storybook:* http://localhost:6006/

** =devenv=
Assuming you have Nix and =devenv= in place, running a development environment
is as simple as invoking:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
devenv up
#+end_src

** =docker compose=
With =docker compose= one needs to start their PostgreSQL container ahead of
invoking the setup task like so:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
just dev
just setup
#+end_src

It is possible to run =just setup= without PostgreSQL running, but you'll
encounter an error when the setup tasks tries to apply database migrations.

* What's in the box?
- [[https://reactrouter.com/home][React Router]] is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React
  18 to React 19.
- [[https://pnpm.io/][pnpm]] for lightning-fast installation speeds and a smarter, safer way to manage
  dependencies.
- [[https://storybook.js.org/][Storybook]] is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in
  isolation.

[[https://devenv.sh/][devenv]] is an optional dependency that automates the installation of project
dependencies and coordinates development processes. One can run =devenv up= to
run a full-featured local environment.

For those who prefer use of containers, we have a Docker Compose configuration
compatible with tools like Docker and Podman.

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
just dev
#+end_src

** Just tasks
#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim :exports results
just --list
#+end_src

    [db]
    db-migrate *args   # Apply pending migrations
    db-migration *args # Create a new migration file
    db-reset           # Remove project PostgreSQL state
    psql               # Start an interactive psql session

    [dev]
    dev                # Start development environment using Docker Compose
    fmt                # Format project source files
    lint               # Lint project source files
    serve              # Run the node server
    setup              # Prepare local development environment
    storybook          # Start Storybook
    storybook-build    # Build Storybook

    [docker]
    docker *args       # Run docker compose commands

    [release]
    check              # Type check source files
    start              # Start the app in production mode

    [test]
    test               # Run project test suite
#+end_example

* Tasks
We have more tasks than time allows. This is intentional. Part of working
together is deciding what to tackle, how deeply to go, and when to move on.

There is no expectation to finish everything. We're interested in how you
approach problems, the trade-offs you consider, and how you communicate your
thinking.

Each task should result in working code integrated with the database and
accessible in the UI.

In each task we're interested in your approach to validation, testing, and
presentation. We're an early stage company so pragmatism and the ability to make
well-informed decisions independently are incredibly important.

** Task 1: Create objectives
Build the foundation for an objective-tracking feature. Users should be able to
create an objective with a title and optional description.

** Task 2: Delete objectives
Add the ability to remove an objective.

** Task 3: Complete objective
Allow marking an objective as completed.
